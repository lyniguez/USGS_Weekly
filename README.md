# Unit 17 | Assignment - Visualizing Data with Leaflet

This project wsa about creating an interactive visualization using Leaflet showing Earthquake Data from USGS Data.

The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

### Step 1: Basic Visualization

The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. 
   
From the [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) page, I selected to plot the weekly data for all earthquakes.

2. **Import & Visualize the Data**

Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.

   * The data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes are larger and have a darker color.

   * Each data point shows a popup that provides additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

### Step 2: More Data

We added a second layer to the map to show the tectonic plates around the world.

   * Each plate will show a pop that provides additional information when clicked.
